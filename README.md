# Design Detailed Document

## Description of my work

My practical work II is composed of one main page, called index.html, where you can find a brief description of how the page is designed. From that page, you can access the rest of the pages, also you can go back from all pages to the index again. A brief description of the content of the pages are: 

- Contact page: a form to have an easy way to contact me.
- About me page: here it appears information about me, my curriculum vitae and some links to my personal social pages.
- Degree page, and within the FCE page: a list of my double degree courses, divided by years. Also, the course of Fundamentals of Computer Engineering has his own page, whose content is detailed.
- Topic page: topic page is dedicated to Medical Robots, whose content includes a brief introduction and three types of medical robots.
- Net page: I include here some links to my colleagues' websites.

All of this was coded by me, using HTML and CSS, for the design, and based on the class slides, as well as the help of some of my colleagues. Also, I use Git and Github to develop my work, as it is a good practice to have it all saved step by step in case there are any errors. Furthermore, I dediced to work on a different branch called dev because the main should be only for the finished project. After finishing everything, I merged the branch name dev into the main branch.

## Problems during the development

Talking about the problems I have had, I must poing out that a big problem related with the main class in HTML, as I called the main class body and I could not. When I found out, I needed to change the half of the pages to have everything in their correct position.
Another issue was finding the way to align everything to the middle of the page because there were some code conflicts from CSS. Nevertheless, I could find the way to solve it.

## Conclusions

To conclude this work, I want to expose some reflections. Thanks to this project, I could learn a new programming language that is completely different from the one I know. It was really interesting to code this website, as it was a challenge for me to do something complex on a programming language that I did not control, it was like jumping out of a plane without a parachute and managing to fly. I am excited to learn more and improve my skills in web design and web development in general.
