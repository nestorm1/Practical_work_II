                    <h3>Content of FCE</h3>
                    <p>This course offers the first fundamentals of computer engineering and its content is divided into two parts, a practical part and a theoretical part.</p>
                    <p>The theoretical part consists of three parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Computer Engineering in Society:</strong> this part gives a historical perspective of computer engineering, as well as explaining the academic discipline and the human factor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information and Data:</strong> The representation and organisation of information is taught here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information Processing, Management and Transmission:</strong> here are the fundamentals, current paradigms and trends within computer engineering.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The practical part consists of the development of practical skills where an introduction to web development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page.</p>

                <div class="information-box">
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The objectives of the course are to provide students not only with the basic skills of a computer engineer, but also with the soft-skills necessary to be able to develop properly, both professionally and personally. Obviously, the aim is for students to understand the concepts and information within the contents in order to, for example, to know what an engineer contributes to society, to question one's professional vocation and to recognise the importance of the human being in the world of computer science.</p>

                    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>At the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand and use technical terminology in Computer Engineering related to hardware and software.</li>
                        <li>Analyze and relate historical and future trends in computing.</li>
                        <li>Represent and organize information effectively within a computer system.</li>
                        <li>Explain foundational areas of Computer Engineering, including hardware, software, and networking.</li>
                        <li>Develop a functional web-based system for information dissemination.</li>
                        <li>Conduct research and present computer-related projects both orally and in writing.</li>
                    </ul>
